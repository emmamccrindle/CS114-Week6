<h1>
    Real friends, how many of us?
    How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
    It's not many of us, we smile at each other
    But how many honest? Trust issues
    Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
    I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
    I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
    Hope you're doin' your thing too
    I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
    Fuck the church up by drinkin' after communion
    Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
    In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
    Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
    I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
    Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
    Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
    When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
    When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?
