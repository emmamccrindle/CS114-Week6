<h1>
    I been waiting for a minute
    For my, lady
    So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
    I been living without limits
    As far as my business
    I'm the only one that's in control
    I been feeling all I've given
    For my children
    I will die for those I love
    God, I'm willing
    To make this my mission
    Give up the women
    Before I lose half of what I own
    I been thinking
    About my vision
    Pour out my feelings
    Revealing the layers to my soul, my soul
    The layers to my soul
    Revealing the layers to my soul
