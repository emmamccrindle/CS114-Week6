    Take the top off, let the sun come in
    (Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
    Woah, for all my dogs that stayed down, we up again (yeah)
    (Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
    Oh, I got dirt on my name, I got white on my beard
    I had debt on my books, it's been a shaky ass year
    Let me make this clear, so all y'all see
    I don't take advice from people less successful than me, huh?
    Ain't no love lost, but the gloves off
    And we up in this bitch until they turn the club off
    Had to tell the dogs "Turn the snubs off"
    Plus they already mad that the Cubs lost
    (The Lord still shines on you)
    (Believe it or not)
    These two wrongs'll right you
    (Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
    I was too grown in high school
    (Believe it or not)
    The true soul of Ice Cube
    Too close to snipe you (the Lord still shines on you)
    Truth told, I like you
    (Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
    Too bold to type you
    (Believe it or not)
    Too rich to fight you
    Calm down, you light skin!
